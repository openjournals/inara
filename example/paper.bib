  abstract = {A recipe prepares your data for modeling. We provide an extensible framework for pipeable sequences of feature engineering steps provides preprocessing tools to be applied to data. Statistical parameters for the steps can be estimated from an initial data set and then applied to other data sets. The resulting processed output can then be used as inputs for statistical or machine learning models.},

With tabular data, practitioners often perform that burdensome activity on local machines by writing ad hoc scripts with libraries based on the Pandas dataframe API and testing them on samples of the entire dataset---the faster the library, the less idle time its users have.},
